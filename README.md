The final product is not a complete finished faithfull 1:1

many of the fonts and styling is not in place. And the images and sections do not have the correct proportions. There is also an issue in the free membership section where the images are not aligned with the text. 

It is 1am on wednesday(thursday) and I've worked on this all week. I'm writting this readme before i've even hosted the site on github pages.

HOWEVER, I am proud that I've at least got most of the images, and colors, and correct alignment for let's say about 70% of it. I think once I've become more competent with CSS I'll return to this and complete it.

The site is live and hosted by github pages which can be accessed [here](https://your-github-pages-link)
